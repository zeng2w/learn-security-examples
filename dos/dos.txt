- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Validating input data to ensure it matches the expected format and type before processing. For IDs, this often means verifying the input matches a valid ObjectId format.
Sanitizing input data to remove or escape characters that could be used in injection attacks.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
1. Enable Rate Limiting: Protects against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make to the application within a specified timeframe.
2. Adopt Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification before gaining access.
